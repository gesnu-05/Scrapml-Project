# Scrapml-Project
ScrapML is a deep learning project for automatic waste classification using PyTorch. It simulates a real-time conveyor system that classifies materials like paper, glass, and metal, logs results with confidence scores, and flags uncertain predictions to support smarter, automated recycling.
